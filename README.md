# MERN Stack Bookshelf App

This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) along with Tailwind CSS for styling and Vite for frontend tooling. The app allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books.

## Features

- **Create**: Users can add new books to the collection by providing details such as title, author, publish year, etc.
- **Read**: Users can view the list of books available in the collection with details.
- **Update**: Users can edit the details of existing books, such as modifying the title, author, publish year, etc.
- **Delete**: Users can remove books from the collection.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is used as the database to store book information.
- **Express.js**: Express.js is used to handle server-side logic and routing.
- **React.js**: React.js is used to build the frontend user interface.
- **Node.js**: Node.js is used as the server-side runtime environment.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the user interface components.
- **Vite**: Vite is used for fast and optimized frontend development.
